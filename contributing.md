## How to contribute to Pawpaw

#### **Did you find a bug?**

* **Do not open up a GitHub issue if the bug is a security vulnerability in Pawpaw**, and instead to refer to the [security policy](https://rubyonrails.org/security).

* **Ensure the bug was not already reported** by searching on GitHub under [Issues](https://github.com/rlayers/pawpaw/issues).

* If you're unable to find an open issue addressing the problem, [open a new one](https://github.com/rlayers/pawpaw/issues/new). Be sure to include a **title and clear description**, as much relevant information as possible, and a **code sample** or an **executable test case** demonstrating the expected behavior that is not occurring.

#### **Did you write a patch that fixes a bug?**

* Open a new GitHub pull request with the patch.

* Ensure the PR description clearly describes the problem and solution. Include the relevant issue number if applicable.

#### **Did you fix whitespace, format code, or make a purely cosmetic patch?**

Changes that are cosmetic in nature and do not add anything substantial to the stability, functionality, or testability of Rails will generally not be accepted.

#### **Do you have questions about the source code?**

* Ask Robert any question about how to use PawPaw via <a alt="e-mail" href="email@a.nov.guy@gmail.com">a.nov.guy@gmail.com</a>.

#### **Do you want to contribute to the PawPaw documentation?**

* I'd love to hear feedback on expanding or improving documents.

Thanks! :heart: :heart: :heart:

Robert
