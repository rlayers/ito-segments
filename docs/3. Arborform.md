# Arborform

## Introduction

Pawpaw supports the rapid creation of complex text parsers using the arborform module, which id divided into two sub-modules:

``itorator``[^itorator_name]: Generator-based pipelined ``Ito`` creation 
``postorator``: Pipelined ``Ito`` sequence consolidation

# Demo

A common NLP task involves breaking a down text in smaller chunks.  For example, a document can be broken
into paragraphs, which in turn can be broken into sentences, words, and so on.

^[itorator_name]: The name "Itorator" comes from a portmanteau of "Ito" and "Iterator"
