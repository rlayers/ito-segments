# Segment and Span

## Segment

Given a `str` of length _n_, a _segment_ consists of a start and stop value that are:

- ordered
- between zero and n inclusive

For a given `str`, a segment defines a _substring_ of characters that are _contained in_ or _equal to_ the `str`.  If the segment has a non-zero start value, or a stop value less than `len(str)`, then it defines a _proper substring_, i.e., one that is _non-equal_ to `str`.  A segment whose stop and start values are equal is valid, and defines an _empty substring_ (i.e., zero length) at a specific location.

## Span Class

In Python, a segment can be represented by a `tuple` of `int` values.  This is defined in the segments module as a named tuple:

```
class Span(typing.NamedTuple):
    start: int
    stop: int
```

A `Span` can be used as start and stop values wherever needed.  For example, the `str.find` methdod locates the first occurrence of a substring, and features optional `start` and `end` parameters that indicate where in the `str` to search.  These parameters can be supplied via a `Span`:

### Example 1
```
s = ' has leading and trailing spaces '
span = Span(1, len(s) - 1)
s.find(' ', *span)  # Find index of first non-leading space
````
Likewise, a `Span` can be easily converted to a Python `slice` object:

### Example 2
```
s = ' has leading and trailing spaces '
_slice = slice(*span)
string[_slice]  # slice off leading and trailing spaces
````

Note that a `slice` allows negative or omitted start and stop parameters.  So although a segment can always be converted to a slice, the reverse is not true:

```
s = slice(-10, 1)
(s.start, s.stop)  # Tuple has negative values - not a valid segment
s = slice(3)
(s.start, s.stop)  # Tuple missing .start - not a valid segment

>>> (-10, -1)
>>> (None, 3)
```

## Further Considerations
A segment can be though of as a one dimenstional vector having a location at start, and a length of stop minus stop.  For example:
```
s = Span(3, 5)
location = span.start
length = span.stop - span.start
```
