Traversal & Query
=================

Introduction
============
Pawpaw's ``Ito`` class features recursive storage of descendants to arbitrary depth, which allows it to
be used as a hierarchical data store.  Traversal down to child nodes is possible through the the
``.children`` property, while traversal upwards can be accomplished through the ``.parent`` property:

>>> from pawpaw import Ito
>>> s = 'the quick brown fox'
>>> re = regex.compile(r'(?:(?P<word>(?P<char>\w)+)\W*)*')
>>> i = Ito.from_match(re.fullmatch(s))
>>> last_child = i.children[-1]  # traverse down to child
>>> str(last_child)  
'fox'
>>> str(last_child.parent)  # traverse up to parent
'the quick brown fox'

Pawpaw's ``Ito`` also allows you to traverse all descendants in at tree from a given node:

>>> print('|'.join(str(d) for d in i.walk_descendants()))
the|t|h|e|quick|q|u|i|c|k|brown|b|r|o|w|n|fox|f|o|x

Manually traversing an ``Ito`` the hierarchy is practical for small collections.  Larger collections,
by contrast, can benefit from Pawpaw *plumule* queries.  Plumule is similar in syntax to
`XPath <https://www.w3.org/TR/xpath/>` in syntax and usage.  For example:

>>> plumule_xpr = '*{*[s:o]}'  # words containing char 'o'
>>> print([str(w) for w in i.find_all(plumule_xpr)])
['brown', 'fox']

Because Plumule queries are strings, they can be persisted and used against multiple trees.  Plumule
queries are interpreted by the Pawpaw *radicle* query engine, which even allows you to pre-compile
them for faster performance:

>>> query = pawpaw.query.compile(plumule_xpr)
>>> print([str(w) for w in query.find_all(i)])
['brown', 'fox']

Plumule Syntax
==============

TODO: Short overview, e.g., a Plumule query consists of one or more *phrases* separated by fore-slash characters::

 query := phrase [/ phrase] [/ phrase] ...

Phrases
-------
A phrase consists of an *axis* along with an optional *filter* and *subquery* parts::

phrase := axis [filter] [subquery]

Axis
----
An axis consists of an optional *order operator*, an *axis identifier*, and an optional *self option*: ::

 axis := [order_operator] axis_identifier [self_option]

An axis defines a traversal step.  For example, the axis identifier ``*`` indicates that traversal
should proceed to the children of the current node(s).  For a given node, an axis may yield zero,
one, or more nodes, the order of which will always be from nearest to farthest from the current node.

.. admonition:: Key Concept

   An axis always returns nodes ordered *nearest* to *farthest* from the current node(s), unless reversed.

The order of nodes can be reversed by using a minus character (-) for the order operator.  A plus
character (+) indicates nearest-to-furthest ordering, and is the assumed default when the
order operator is not supplied.

In some cases, it may be useful to return the current node as part traversal step.  For example,
the axis operator ``..`` indicates traversal to the parent node, however, if the current node is
a root, then there is no parent to traverse to.  The self option can be used to ensure that a
traversal step will always return something.  Two possible values are allows:

Self Option Values:

======  ====================================================
Value   Description
======  ====================================================
``!``   Returns current node only if traversal step is empty
------  ----------------------------------------------------
``!!``  Returns current node plus any traversal step nodes
======  ====================================================

If a self option is supplied, the current node will always be returned first, unless
the axis is reversed with the '-' operator.

Filter
------

A filter only allows nodes matching a given criteria to pass through.  The general form for a filter is:

 filter := [~] [[~]key:value] ] | [&, ^, or |] [~] [[~]key:value] ] | ...

A filter must include a key-value pair.  The key indicates a action to perform.  The axis nodes, along with the filter value,
are used as parameters for this action.  Allowed keys are as follows:

+---------------------+------------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+------------------+
| Key                 | Alt Keys(s)      | Meaning                                                                | Example(s)       |

Each key-value pair can be optionally preceeded by a non-combining logical operator (NOT).  Adjacenet key-value pairs must be separated from one another by a combining logical operator (AND, XOR, or OR).

TIPS & TRICKS
=============

Q: How can I 'OR' together a filter and subquery?

A: Operators are not supported between the filter and subquery components of a query phrase.  However, you can achieve the same result by moving the filter to a subquery:

[my_filter]{my_subquery}  ->  {./[my_filter]}OR{my_subquery}


.. [#] The name "In Test Object" is historical, and dates back to earlier projects I developed.  I've chosen to keep this name because "Ito" makes for a short, convenient type name.

.. [#] In Python, strings are also immutable.

.. [#] Because a child ``Ito`` must be equal to or contained by a parent ``Ito``, this is a *tree* graph.
