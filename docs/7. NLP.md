Pawpaw is well suited for Natural Language Processing (NLP) software development.  NLP is a deep topic, and it can sometimes be difficult to select which state of the art (SoA) approaches are best suited for your particular data and needs.

The intent of Pawpaw's ``nlp`` module is not serve as a replacement for all of the excellent work that has been done in this field.  Rather, ``nlp`` is available as a "quick and dirty" toolbox for trying out new ideas and approaches.  It offers a good combination of features and performance for lexical English data.
