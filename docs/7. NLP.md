## Introduction

Pawpaw is well suited for Natural Language Processing (NLP) software development.  NLP is a deep topic, and it can sometimes be difficult to select which state of the art (SoA) approaches are best suited for your particular data and needs.

The intent of Pawpaw's ``nlp`` module is not serve as a replacement for the excellent work that has been done in this field.  Rather, ``nlp`` is available as a simple and easy to use toolbox that offers an excellent balance of features and performance for English language data.

The ``nlp`` contains a variety of useful lexical data marker collections for Python unicode strings:

* ``byte_order_controls``
* ``unicode_white_space_LF_FF``
* ``unicode_white_space_eol``
* ``unicode_white_space_other``
* ``unicode_single_quote_marks``
* ``unicode_double_quote_marks``
* ``unicode_bullets``

NLP methods are split among a class hierarchy, whose base class is ``NlpComponent``:
